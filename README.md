## Hello, I'm Jennie 👋🏻

I'm a hybrid design engineer who loves elegant user interfaces, intuitive user experiences, and beautifully crafted code. I enjoy building scalable design systems while helping designers and engineers work better together. 

👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently helping lead the design system team at Atlassian and the evolution of [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design).

I loveee talking about design systems, please say hello [@jenniesyip](https://www.twitter.com/jenniesyip)~
