# 📖 Jennie's Manual

Oh hello! 👋🏻 This is a living and breathing manual, just like a design system.  I hope it helps us work better together. Please let me know of anything I should change in this manual as I grow in my role.

### My style

- **Poke poke.** When I see a problem, I often own the problem. If things are unclear, I ask questions, seek the right people to come together, and try to get everyone on the same page.
- I’m a **systems thinker**. I approach everything holistically and love analyzing the relationships between the system’s parts to understand the potential for better decision making.
- I (try my best) to lead by example, always with integrity. I believe that **leadership is a conscious, daily practice.** We’re all responsible for leadership and luckily, we’re constantly surrounded by opportunities to lead.
- **Count on me~** I am loyal, meticulous and responsible. When a plan has been established, I am very passionate about bringing those ideas to life. 

------

### What I value

- I am transparent and highly communicative. When I learn new information or skills, I like to share my learnings as widely as possible so **everyone benefits**. There’s always room to grow.
- I value **authenticity**, honesty, and transparency. If I say something you disagree with, let me know. I don’t mind being challenged in thoughtful and constructive ways. 
- I believe in surrounding yourself with people who see the world differently than you. **They’ll fill in your blind spots if you let them.** Thanks for teaching me. ❤️
- I value quality time and collaboration with my **TEAM**. I thrive best in environments where teammates trust each other, can own their decisions, and run like a self-oiled machine. I love bouncing ideas, whether it be going back and forth on how to name something, pulling our hair out over some failing ci test, or just hanging out and having some drinks together.

### What I don’t have the patience for

- I default to **trust**… but if my confidence is shaken, it often takes time to rebuild. Ways to lose my trust: not following through, consistent inconsistencies, or treating others with disrespect.
- I am turned off by egos, entitlement, selfishness, and those who break rules for personal gain.
- 🚲 [Bikeshedding](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Parkinsons-law-of-triviality-bikeshedding) and endless exploration — analysis and data are crucial, but nothing is ever perfect. Let’s baseline, make executive decisions, and **start building together**. We can reflect, learn quickly from failures, and iterate from there.
- Micromanagement. I’m very self-driven, resourceful and **autonomous** — the more you ask me to do something, the less I’m inclined to do it.

### How to best communicate with me

- Just ping me! :) I rely on technology to protect my time, so if I respond off-hours, no worries, I’m doing so intentionally.
- I work on a[ maker's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) and believe in **preserving focus time**. I keep my calendar updated, respect other’s schedules, and like to prepare an agenda.
- Since I'm remote, please over-communicate with me. **Help be my 🙈 eyes and 🙉 ears in the room.** From this distance, I can't feel the sentiment of the room or see how a teammate is doing.
- Don't be a stranger — I want to know you personally as an individual. I want to learn how you like to be appreciated (me? words of affirmation), what your hobbies are (🌱propagating plants)… or what your fav component is.

### How you can help me

- I’ve spent much of my career as a lone designer/developer and as a result, often believe the **responsibility is mine alone to bear**. If you see me slipping into 🐺 lone-wolf mode, please remind me that I'm on this amazing team that I can share, spar, and delegate to! Legends.  
- If I go quiet or aloof, it’s usually because I’m **processing**. I’m contemplating what to say in light of my experience and the current situation. Please don’t hesitate to ask me to chime in during a meeting — sometimes I’m trying to figure out the right time to interrupt.
- **Remote is hard!** Please send an agenda and Zoom in advance, esp if we haven’t discussed the meeting prior. In big conference rooms, it helps to enunciate. I also love seeing your faces and expressions, it would be great if you can dial in from your laptop!

### What people misunderstand about me

- I’m an [introvert](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) [at](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISTJ) [heart](https://keirsey.com/temperament/guardian-inspector/) ([ISTJ](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISTJ/)), but strangely, a professional extrovert in design system settings. 😝 It takes me a while to warm up to people in new environments, especially in large groups. If you see me alone at an event or in my pod, **please say 👋🏻hi!**
- I usually keep my feelings to myself unless asked. But when asked... #realtalk... and sometimes, the truth may win out over tact. My **commitment to truth** may come out as being insensitive, but I’m usually experiencing internal conflict around trying to be tactful or diplomatic.
- I’m a hybrid designer/developer and depending on my current title or role, people often think I’m just one or the other. I often feel some imposter syndrome due to this **identity crisis**. I’m always aiming to squash my inner critic and embrace this space.
